# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to run the project

1. Clone the Project locally

2. Run "npm install

3. Run "npm start"

4. Hard coded some username and passwords to test the functionality of login page.
   PFA src\users.json file.

5. I haven't added complete functionality to the signup and forgot password page submit form, as the users data is hard coded, but does the field validation in those pages.
